# Key takeaways

Static websites are easy to create if you have an initial idea that you want to create. Wireframes are useful in this sense since it gives you an idea of the structure of your HTML. I learned that using HTML as the layout of the content and using CSS as the design helps me to seperate the role of content and design.
